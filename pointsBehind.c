/*You are participating in a game in which players collect points for various solved puzzles. 
In the end, the player with the highest score wins.
You would like to know how far behind the highest-scoring person everyone else is in order 
to know whether you still have a chance at winning. 

Please write a C program that uses a function "behind()" (which you also have to write) in
order to help with this task. 
Your program should first read, from the user input, the number of players participating 
in the game. There are never more than 10 players in the game.
Next, your program should readthe current scores of each player and store them in an array. 
Then you should call the function behind(), to which you pass as a first argument, the array
holding the player's scores, and as a second argument the number of players in the game. 
The function behind should replace the scores stored in the array with the number of points 
by which each individual player is behind the top-scoring player.
